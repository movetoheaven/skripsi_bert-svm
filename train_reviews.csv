batman reboot titular dc superhero film franchise directed co written matt reeves cloverfield dawn planet apes war planet apes starring robert pattinson lead role well zoe kravitz paul dano colin farrell best batman film grace screens feature involvement christopher nolan two years adopting vigilante alter ego batman young reclusive billionaire bruce wayne robert pattinson summoned police lieutenant james gordon jeffrey wright help investigate murder gotham city mayor halloween night upon closer inspection soon learn killer referring riddler paul dano intends kill important political figures leaving behind cryptic messages batman process deciphering messages bruce discovers riddler motivation murders runs deeper thought point involves gotham city hidden crime syndicate also family legacy really need give detailed introduction someone like batman one iconic superheroes time everybody dog knows many films made years feature caped crusader escapades criminals tim burton michael keaton led movies took character seriously christopher nolan christian bale led dark knight trilogy often ranked among greatest superhero films ever made matt reeves vision brought life batman yet another fantastic depiction popular hero engaging film embraces detective roots many people seem forget addition fighting crime fists high tech gadgets batman also accomplished detective strategy using stealth sneak around clues well superior powers deduction rivalled likes sherlock holmes unfortunately quirk really touched upon past movies instead focusing action based aspects character likely casual audiences would find moments fun watch course loved film makes batman detective work focal point story pragmatic tries unravel mystery riddler crimes using brute force absolutely necessary mind film clearly taken influence detective noir movies many decades ago like chinatown french connection like two examples one focus much action rather main character intellect solve enigmatic puzzle personally enjoyed seeing otherwise glanced character trait batman understand audiences might think way previously mentioned much action batman films imagine may complaints want scenes hand hand combat another similarity film classic noir fiction wonderful cinematography many memorable shots show batman silhouetted among skyline gotham city often complimented beautiful colour palette help stand noir literally mean black french certainly fits character like batman tee one scene takes place almost entirely dark form light illuminating characters gunfire would normally difficult see given circumstances made much comprehensible thanks matt reeves slick direction reeves makes clear gotham rife corruption crime emphasising showing nobody without sin though bruce morally upstanding citizen skeletons closet regarding family history likewise even certain members police department shown ties criminal underworld story elements coming together surprise lot ground covered film ends clocking three hours length minutes precise matt reeves solid directing miracle manages make work harmoniously within given timeframe severity riddler murders taking place gotham city actually aids giving film sufficient world building see nightclub run local mafia politicians lying repairing urgently needs fixed media manipulating facts means bring ratings result gotham feels like actual location inhabited real people simply used obvious new york city landmarks basis e g gotham state building instead empire state building echo true real world much hellish place something conceived fiction perhaps even addition batman movies also known unforgettable soundtracks tim burton films complimented danny elfman energetic musical score christopher nolan dark knight trilogy benefited strongly hans zimmer grandiose use horns drums seems add michael giacchino dark brooding music list memorable batman scores many remember years main theme definitely suits film despondent tone complete downbeat piano notes giving haunting feeling lost also liked film used nirvana something way convey going bruce wayne mind lyrics metaphor isolated rest society course highly appropriate considering bruce reclusive nature working actor right could played particular incarnation dark knight better robert pattinson battinson hopefully finally shed shackles stigma associated twilight series since role proud instead pattinson depicts bruce wayne deeply insecure man still reeling trauma losing parents reflected inexperience donning superhero uniform usually whenever see batman bruce wayne dynamic ever shown bruce morose personality juxtaposed batman one track minded determination lines blurred times see bruce personal feelings getting way decision making batman presents interesting point vulnerability character tend see makes easier audience identify zoe kravitz also great selena kyle catwoman always enjoyed watching catwoman interactions batman throughout various forms media ones film rank among best two believable chemistry since neither truly evil good essentially making ideal grey area character despite different social classes kyle downtrodden worldview resonates strongly bruce equally pessimistic vision future gotham city naturally leads great scenes help bring spark hope things could turn better worked together matters always seem prevent moving forward film main antagonist paul dano puts intriguing spin riddler instead man dressed green wearing hat question mark dano riddler draped large poncho like outfit mask obscures entire face intimidating figure always seems least five steps ahead batman police department riddles leaves behind crime scenes akin real life zodiac killer complex patterns codes hard decipher first glance clever idea make allusions infamous murderer especially since mystery zodiac killer really remains unsolved day also playing important role film colin farrell oswald cobblepot penguin like batman version penguin still relatively inexperienced compared depictions movies tv shows farrell completely unrecognisable makeup much kept forgetting playing character cannot discuss significance story much since would give away important spoilers say leaves much impression riddler considering high quality three predecessors batman definitely lot live wake left behind helped achieve flying colours atypical direction took things primarily harkening back detective focused origins something works superhero film neo noir film rolled one top also unique portrayal main character robert pattinson solidify film legacy one best entire franchise according matt reeves sequels confirmed way able recapture lightning bottle exciting times lie ahead rate solid,positive
